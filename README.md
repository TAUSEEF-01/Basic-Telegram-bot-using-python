# Basic-Telegram-bot-using-python

Hi there! I'm Tauseef.
<br>The code needed to create a Telegram bot is available here.
<br>This package could be necessary for you. 
<br>Enter this command (for Windows users only) at the Command Prompt. --> pip install python-telegram-bot
<br>For this, I used the Python IDE Pycharm. Use the IDE that you like.
